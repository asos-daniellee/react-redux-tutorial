# React and Redux Tutorials

This repository gives some basic examples of React and Redux to aid in learning how to use them.

We are using webpack-dev-server to run the examples but it is all set up and no knowledge of how it works is required.  I am documenting the commands to run the examples using `yarn` but you can replace this with `npm run` if you prefer.

## Setup

Before you can run the examples you must install dependencies using:

```
yarn
```
